Game_v2 - Space Portal, a commodore 64 game

This is a commodore64 game, written in assembly for the MOS6502, using the SIDII for sounds.
During the development, I started to remember all registers by heart. To go back and modify, would be a different story.

This was an exercise, to develop a game for the micro processor that me, and many other loved so much in it's day.
The reason I had one was to create my own game. I was 8 years old. 36 years later, I finally have accomplishd a game 
with 1 level. I hope you enjoy it. The prg file will run with your favourite c64 emulator.
